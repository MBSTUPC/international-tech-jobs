#### Motivation for relocate

- Wanted to join an international company.
- Tech jobs are drying up in Bangladesh.


#### Experiences

At the time I moved to Amsterdam, I had 5 years of industry experience.


#### How did I Start looking abroad jobs

Started looking into all the job boards, picking the right one and apply.


#### Relocating

- Company handled everything which includes visa/work permit and 1 month accommodation.
- Papers I needed:
  * Passports.
  * Marriage certificate, translated and notarized since it was in Bangla.
  * Birth Certificates (both my wife and I), need to be translated and notarized too.
- Carry papers when you fly:
  * Offer latter.
  * Health insurance.
  * Accommodation confirmation paper.
- Bring all the certificates.
- Previous job's offer latter and experience latter.
- Always ask the HR / contact in the company which paper to bring. If are just applying, you may prepare papers like
translated and notarized documents.


#### Tips or Guidance for others

- Talk with someone friendly who been though the process.
- Interview invite is tough:
  * Don't blindly apply. Search for the company online. Glassdoor, LinkedIn and company website might be helpful.
  * Modify your CV according to the information you got in the last step. Read the job post multiple times, check
  what they want.
  * Add personal projects, try to build something cool.
- When applying jobs:
  * Try to send the application as an email.
  * Don't send generic email to all. Write something that people might get interested.
- Homework or assignment:
  * Company might ask you to do a homework to check your skill.
  * Do it in a way you know best.
  * Show your code to someone who might be better than you.
- Interview:
  * Read interview tips online.
  * I went though lots of interviews, the more you do, the more you get better.
  * Do mock interview with friends.
  * Work on you communication skill aka English conversation.
  * Make sure you got good internet connection.
  * Make sure room is quite and has enough light. Ceiling fan create tons of noise.
  * Try to make a conversation rather answering the question interviewer ask. Joke around.
